**About**
This is the final project for the COMP1020 course at VinUniversity. The purpose of this project is to create a simple library for graph operations, making it easier to use and summarizing all the course content related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Graph Data Structures, and Graph Algorithms.

**Updated:**
We have successfully developed a better without-inheritance approach to make this library, you can find a single unified graph class, the graph manager as well as examples of input and output in WithoutInheritance folder
.
